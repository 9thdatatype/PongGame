Known Bugs:
	- Occasionally one or both of the paddles will randomly jump off the screen
*********************

program wide: 
	- Please use proper javadocs formatting for the method and class documentation
	- If editing a source file that was not originally created by you please add a comment with your name and the date you edited
	and what the edits were and maybe a brief reason why.
	- Try to post on slack if you are editing files so that no one tries to edit the same files at the same time
	- It would be nice to incorporate a method or some way of telling what object was clicked on
		- I don't know if this should be handled by physics or not
		- Maybe handled by individual GameStates
	- Please comment out System.out.println(); when you push.
		- Just so that when other people are debugging it wont clutter the console.
	- Should the maximum frames per second be read as a configuration setting?
	- It would be nice to have all positions relative so the screen can be resized.
	- Should the background colour be a configuration setting?

GameStateManagers.InGameManager:
	- This class holds the main game loop but should it hold the in game logic? Dan?
	
GameStateManagers.GameMenu:
	- The draw main menu should be looked at by Daniel Thertell
	- Maybe some better looking buttons :P
	- This should decide where to go depending on which button was pressed I think - Jonathan
	
gameObject.GameObject:
	- This should be made into an abstract class with methods that need to be defined in child classes.
		- Haven't decided how or what so please don't touch yet

EngineComponents.Physics:
	- Murilo you know what you need to do
	- Also if any objects points are returned it would be nice to work with the centers and not a corner
	- Add function to check a point and an arraylist of objects.  return the object clicked or null if nothing was clicked
