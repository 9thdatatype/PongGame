Known Bugs:
*********************

program wide: 
	- Please use proper javadocs formatting for the method and class documentation
	- If editing a source file that was not originally created by you please add a comment with your name and the date you edited
	and what the edits were and maybe a brief reason why.
	- Try to post on slack if you are editing files so that no one tries to edit the same files at the same time
	- Please comment out System.out.println(); when you push.
		- Just so that when other people are debugging it wont clutter the console.
	- It would be nice to have all positions relative so the screen can be resized.
	- Change all Point class direct field references to the getter methods.
   *- Put * beside new additions to ToDo list to make them easier to find?
