*	Please format all additions to this file in the following way:

program wide: 
	- Please use proper javadocs formatting for the method and class documentation
	- If editing a source file that was not originally created by you please add a comment with your name and the date you edited
	and what the edits were and maybe a brief reason why.
	- Try to post on slack if you are editing files so that no one tries to edit the same files at the same time
	- It would be nice to incorporate a method or some way of telling what object was clicked on
		- I don't know if this should be handled by physics or not
		- Maybe handled by individual GameStates
	- Please comment out System.out.println(); when you push.
		- Just so that when other people are debugging it wont clutter the console.

GameStateManagers:
	- A class needs to be created for the InGameState
		- this class should hold the main game loop
		- constructor needs to take a Graphics2D object and the width and height of the screen
			- this is for rendering
		- Maybe the game logic should be in this class?
	
GameStateManagers.GameMenu:
	- The draw main menu should be look at by Daniel Thertell
	- Maybe some better looking buttons :P
	
gameObject.GameObject:
	- This should be made into an abstract class with methods that need to be defined in child classes.
		- Haven't decided how or what so please don't touch yet

EngineComponents.Physics:
	- Murilo you know what you need to do
