Known Bugs:
	- Tried to use GameObject.translate(dx, dy) and it did nothing
		- This might be causing inconsistencies with the actual center and the center between the tlc and brc
			- Update: it is most certainly causing inconsistencies
			- uncomment line 46 in InGameManager and run the program and hit w
			- then do the same thing with line 47 but re-comment line 46
			- also line 48 is the intent of what line 47 should result in

program wide: 
	- Please use proper javadocs formatting for the method and class documentation
	- If editing a source file that was not originally created by you please add a comment with your name and the date you edited
	and what the edits were and maybe a brief reason why.
	- Try to post on slack if you are editing files so that no one tries to edit the same files at the same time
	- Please comment out System.out.println(); when you push.
		- Just so that when other people are debugging it wont clutter the console.
	- It would be nice to have all positions relative so the screen can be resized.
	- Change all Point class direct field references to the getter methods.
   *- Put * beside new additions to ToDO list to make them easier to find? -Dan
	
GameStateManagers.GameMenu:
	- If Dan is creating a physics object maybe it should be passed to the constructor of the InGameManager
		- To avoid having multiple objects taking up ram
	
gameObject.GameObject:
	- This should be made into an abstract class with methods that need to be defined in child classes.
		- Haven't decided how or what so please don't touch yet
	- Complete the game object with new methods and Constuctors

EngineComponents.Physics:
	- Add function to check a point and an arraylist of objects.  return the object clicked or null if nothing was clicked
	- CHECK FOR FUCKING STALES
	- Encapsulate E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G
	- Javadocs
   *- Use A HashMap? or HashList? -Dan
